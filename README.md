# taps_simu_visualization
Case study.

The environment model gives the meta-models including the rain model and all kinds of device model.
The 30 TAPs are elicited from the user survey.
The deviceInstance file gives the room layout and the device instances.
The system model is generated automatically according to the above information.
The simulation based on the system model results in the simulation traces.
